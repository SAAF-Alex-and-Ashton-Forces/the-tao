◊book*{About}

This is a curated collection of hacker lore scavenged from various parts of the internet. Many of these stories, sayings, etc. were written and published during the early days of the web, before the HTML 5 standard. They might look alright in a plain-text web browser, but they are uncomfortable to read on modern devices. We have carefully typeset these to look fabulous on whatever device you are reading on—be it a modern smartphone or EWW running in Emacs 24.

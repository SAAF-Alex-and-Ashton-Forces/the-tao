#+title: The Tao of Programming, Recast

* Build instructions

Text goes in =tao.html.pm=. You will probably want to install the =pollen-mode= package for Emacs:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package pollen-mode
    :defer t)
#+end_src

This is optional.

You will need [[https://racket-lang.org][Racket]]. Once you have Racket installed, you will need [[https://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/index.html][Pollen]]:

#+begin_src bash
  raco pkg install pollen
#+end_src

Ensure everything is working:

#+begin_src bash
  $ raco pollen test
  raco pollen is installed correctly
#+end_src

Now you can build:

#+begin_src bash
  raco pollen render src/
#+end_src

And it should be built in =src/tao.html=.
